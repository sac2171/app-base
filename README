An application starter for my personal projects.

Frontend -> Create React App # w/ Typescript scripts
Backend  -> Django 1.11 w/ py3
Proxy    -> What the user hits to get past annoying CORS issues

Trying to do something very similar to:
https://github.com/Seedstars/django-react-redux-base

But w/ some of my more personal patterns/idioms.
